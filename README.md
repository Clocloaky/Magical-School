# Magical-School
Final Project - XCode

This project is a game app I designed for an app making contest at SFSU. 
I won first place for the project idea :) but my laptop was a loaner and I do not own an apple product to use xCode rn. 

The project allows you to customize a magical girl and have her go through random events at school while building up her stats to pass exams. 

I plan on moving it to another platform I can access, likely as a react native app. I drew the pfp's in the app and the other assets were from itch.io free assets.
